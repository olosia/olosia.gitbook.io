# ðŸ›° Overview

OLOSIA is a tool that allows users to create flashcards for studying by inputting words or sentences directly. Flashcards are known to be a very effective tool for learning, and with this web service, users can create flashcards by dividing their input into front and back sides.

By making your created flashcards public, more users can visit and use them for studying. Users can select flashcards from various fields and subscribe to them, allowing them to use a variety of flashcards in their desired field.

Flashcards can be useful tools for students, educators, businessmen, and anyone else. OLOSIA can be used on various devices, including mobile and PC, making it available for learning anytime and anywhere.
