# ðŸ›° Overview

We use the same home address format as blogging platforms like Medium or Velog.

Here, you can write a member introduction, and if you set it to public, the list of public memorization lists will be shown to visitors.

Visitors can subscribe to the memorization lists you have made public, and continue their learning through those lists on each member's homepage.
