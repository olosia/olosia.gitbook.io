Each Memory Palace has a separate address, such as [https://olosia.com/@olosia/4567](https://olosia.com/@olosia/4567).

If you set your Memory Palace to public, other users can use your public Memory Palace.

The public Memory Palace can be added to other members' Memory Palace list through the Subscribe button to continue learning.

You can memorize by flipping each card.
